# Isolas in Nonlinear Fluid Networks

This repository contains the [Python notebook](https://github.com/NathanKarst/Isolas/blob/main/isola.ipynb) associated with the manuscript "Isolas in Nonlinear Fluid Networks" by Karst and Geddes. Running the notebook will populate the data folder and use these results to generate the manuscript figures, with the exception of the PDE simulations which were generated with a separate codebase and have been included in the data folder.
